CSC 306 Operating Systems

This repository uses different data structures to perform a simulation of an operating system.

Using a random number generator, you will need to create (4) data sets of 100 random integers 
each with values of 0 to 99. Additionally, you will need to create (1) data set of 100 random 
integers values of 1 to 3. The latter is for priority of the insert priority queue.  

You may create your data sets once and write them to a file for later reading in or you may create them each run.

Create 8 registers.  4 inputs and 4 outputs. (Hint: same size as your data type)
There will be two “runs” your main program. Single register and four registers. 
Use looping to load/unload the queues from the data sets and to your output file. 
Each loop is a clock cycle. Count your clock cycle for each of the two functions. Output these counts to your file.  
Output your input and output data in 10 by 10 matrix to your file.
  
   -> Run one uses a single register to input to queues and a single register output data.
  	-> Run two uses 4 registers to input to queues and 4 registers to output data to files
